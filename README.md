# Bio

Hello! My name is **Teddy Kolios**, and I’m a graduate student in **Computational Analysis and Public Policy (MSCAPP)** at the **University of Chicago**, graduating **June 2026**.

I have a strong foundation in **computer science, software engineering, and data engineering**, with hands-on experience delivering code in fast-paced, production-oriented environments.

My graduate work focuses on **machine learning, statistical modeling, and large-scale data systems**, and I’m actively pursuing **data scientist roles** where I can apply these skills to build scalable, data-driven solutions to real-world problems.

Below are a few projects I’ve worked on recently.
